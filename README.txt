This game is a simple RPG game that I made some time ago, this is written in Esperanto, if this is a issue or you are interested let me know and I will translate to you.

It a simple game where you can run, walk, pick up items, advance levels and have enemies that you can aim and kill, and they will follow you using some simple dijkstra algorithm in java.
