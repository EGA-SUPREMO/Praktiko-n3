# RPG Game template

This game is a simple 2D RPG game, the code is written in Esperanto, if you're interested, let me know and I will translate for you.

It a simple game where you can run, walk, pick up items, advance levels and have enemies that you can aim and kill, and they will follow you using a dijkstra algorithm in Java.

It lacks of quests and needs a little improvement before it can be played by an average user.
