# RPG Game template

This is a template that can be extended to be a simple 2D RPG game, however the code is written in Esperanto, if you're interested, let me know and I will translate for you.

It a simple game where you can run, walk, pick up items, advance levels and have enemies that you can aim and kill, and they will follow you using a dijkstra algorithm in Java.

It lacks of quests, levels, items and needs a improvement before it can be played by an average user.

For the time being this is paused until I or someone else have time or interest in this repo.
